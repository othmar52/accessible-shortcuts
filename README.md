# accessible-shortcuts
script to record special keypress combinations and fires a multiple keypress command on UNIX systems

# Who is it for?
For example paraplegic people who are not able to press 2 keyboard-keys simultanously caused by physical disability

# The concept
People without physical disability are able to press 2 or more keys on their keyboard simultaneously (for example "Ctrl+t" for a new browsertab). With this script you can alternatively fire a "Ctrl+t" by pressing:
* Ctrl
* Ctrl
* Ctrl
* t
